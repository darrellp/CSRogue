Roguelike Work in progress.  So far dungeon generation, FOV and command system.

I think the dungeon generation is nice.  My own jury rigged system.  The FOV is a little wonky on the walls right now and I
think I'm checking some cells twice.  Right now I'm using some old, outdated code for drawing characters but want to move to
SadConsole.  Also, I'd like to stop and regroup a bit and ensure than the interfaces to my map and FOV are generic enough that
I could easily reuse them in future rogue games.
